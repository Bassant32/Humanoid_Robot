# Humanoid_Robot
 Overview

This project aims to design and develop a humanoid robot capable of playing football (soccer).
The robot is programmed to detect, approach, and kick the ball toward the goal using intelligent movement control and vision-based decision-making.

The project combines mechanical design, control systems, computer vision, and embedded programming to simulate a real football-playing humanoid.

 Objectives

Design a humanoid robot capable of dynamic movement and balance.

Implement motor control (servo motors) for walking, turning, and kicking actions.

Integrate image processing to detect the ball and the goal.

Develop a control algorithm for movement decisions based on camera input.

Test the robotâ€™s performance in real-time football scenarios.
